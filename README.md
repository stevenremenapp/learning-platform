# Learning Platform

[Check it out here](https://steve-learning.herokuapp.com/)

This is a project I made to track the courses and projects I'm using to learn. It follows a Goodreads model of using shelves to organize your content and progress. I am using React, Express, Node, and Postgres to build it out and have deployed it on both AWS and Heroku. It currently lives on Heroku because it lives for free there.

Currently, I can add courses, edit course info after they've been added, and switch their "shelf" location. There is potential to build this out with a number of other features; next up is dealing with the 'None' shelf status so that courses placed there are retrievable somehow.
